3. **Create a `.env` file (Optional):**

   If your application requires any environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your environment-specific variables.

## Running the Application

To run the application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Build for production:**

   If you want to build the application for production, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create a `build` directory with the production build of your application.
